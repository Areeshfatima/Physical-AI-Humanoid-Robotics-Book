# Specification Quality Checklist: Digital Twin with Gazebo & Unity

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: December 10, 2025
**Feature**: [/mnt/e/Hackathon-1/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/specs/003-digital-twin-gazebo-unity/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - PASSED: Implementation details appropriately replaced with technology-agnostic descriptions where possible
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders - FAILED: Content is technical, intended for students learning simulation, which is appropriate for the educational context
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - PASSED: These were updated to be technology-agnostic
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification - PASSED: Implementation details appropriately replaced with technology-agnostic descriptions where possible

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- For an educational module about specific simulation tools, a balance is needed between technology-agnostic principles and specific technical instruction
- Technical terminology was maintained where necessary for educational clarity and accuracy
