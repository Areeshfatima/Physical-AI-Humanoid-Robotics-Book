# Implementation Tasks: Docusaurus Branding Fix

**Feature**: Docusaurus Branding Fix | **Date**: Wednesday, December 24, 2025
**Input**: Design artifacts from `/specs/001-branding-fix/`

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation will incrementally deliver the Docusaurus branding fix by prioritizing the highest priority user stories first. Each user story will be implemented as a complete, independently testable increment. The MVP scope includes User Story 1 (image rendering) and User Story 2 (sidebar structure), which provide the core functionality users need for accessing the content.

## Dependencies

User Story 2 (sidebar structure) should be completed before User Story 3 (content updates) and User Story 4 (branding updates) since the proper navigation structure is foundational for the rest of the experience.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- T010-T014 (image assets) can run in parallel with T015-T020 (configuration updates)
- T025-T027 (sidebar restructuring) can run in parallel with T028-T030 (intro/hero updates)

---

## Phase 1: Setup

- [X] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [X] T002 Verify existing project structure matches expected format
- [X] T003 Install any required dependencies if missing
- [X] T004 Set up development environment for Docusaurus project

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

- [X] T005 [P] Update docusaurus.config.js with proper URLs and organization
- [X] T006 [P] Update GitHub URLs in configuration to point to textbook repository
- [X] T007 [P] Verify static asset directory structure exists
- [X] T008 Ensure all documentation files have valid YAML frontmatter
- [X] T009 Test current site build to establish baseline

## Phase 3: [US1] View Correctly Rendered Logo and Images

**User Story Goal**: As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see the properly rendered logo and images instead of alt text, so that I can have a better learning experience with visual content that enhances my understanding.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by visiting the site and confirming that the logo appears correctly in the header and that all images in the documentation pages render properly rather than showing alt text.

**Success Criteria**:
- Given I am on the homepage, when I load the page, then I see the correctly rendered logo in the header instead of alt text
- Given I am browsing any documentation page, when I load the page, then all images display properly instead of alt text descriptions

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create placeholder images for all missing referenced images in module-1-ros2/images/
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Create placeholder images for all missing referenced images in module-2-digital-twin/images/
- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Create placeholder images for all missing referenced images in module-3-isaac/images/
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Create placeholder images for all missing referenced images in module-4-vla/images/
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Verify all image paths reference existing files and update if needed
- [X] T015 [US1] Update logo path in docusaurus.config.js to use book-logo.svg
- [X] T016 [US1] Test image rendering on local development server
- [X] T017 [US1] Validate image optimization to meet 3-second load requirement

## Phase 4: [US2] Access Correctly Ordered and Relevant Content

**User Story Goal**: As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see a properly ordered sidebar with only the required modules, so that I can easily navigate the content in the intended learning sequence.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by viewing the sidebar and verifying it contains only the four required modules in the specified order without any extra pages, categories, or autogenerated items.

**Success Criteria**:
- Given I am viewing any page on the site, when I look at the sidebar, then I see exactly: Module 1, Module 2, Module 3, Module 4 in this order
- Given I am viewing any page on the site, when I look at the sidebar, then I don't see any extra pages, categories, or autogenerated items

- [X] T018 [US2] Map out current sidebar structure and identify unwanted items
- [X] T019 [US2] Update sidebars.js to remove test documents and intro from top level
- [X] T020 [US2] Organize sidebar to show Module 1, Module 2, Module 3, Module 4 in correct sequence
- [X] T021 [US2] Ensure each module shows chapters in proper order (1-4)
- [X] T022 [US2] Remove any extra pages, categories, or autogenerated items
- [X] T023 [US2] Verify sidebar navigation works correctly on all pages
- [X] T024 [US2] Test sidebar structure on mobile and desktop views

## Phase 5: [US3] Experience Book-Focused Content

**User Story Goal**: As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see content that introduces the book's topic, scope, and audience instead of Docusaurus-related content, so that I can understand what the book is about and how to use it.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by examining the introductory page and hero section to confirm they contain book-specific information about topic, scope, and audience.

**Success Criteria**:
- Given I am on the homepage, when I read the intro page, then it introduces the book (topic, scope, audience) instead of Docusaurus
- Given I am on the homepage, when I read the hero section, then it is book-focused (title, subtitle, purpose) instead of Docusaurus-oriented

- [X] T025 [US3] Update docs/intro.md to replace Docusaurus content with book-specific content
- [X] T026 [US3] Update src/pages/index.tsx to replace Docusaurus hero content with book-focused content
- [X] T027 [US3] Update HomepageFeatures component to reflect textbook features instead of Docusaurus features
- [X] T028 [US3] Update meta description in index.tsx to be book-specific
- [X] T029 [US3] Verify intro page introduces the book topic, scope, and audience appropriately
- [X] T030 [US3] Test that hero section is book-focused with appropriate title and subtitle

## Phase 6: [US4] Experience Proper Book Branding

**User Story Goal**: As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see content, footer, and metadata that align with the textbook's branding rather than Docusaurus, so that I have a cohesive and professional learning experience.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by examining the header, footer, and metadata to confirm they reflect the textbook's branding rather than default Docusaurus elements.

**Success Criteria**:
- Given I am on any page of the textbook, when I view the navbar, then it displays book-specific branding with GitHub link pointing to the user-provided book repository
- Given I am on any page of the textbook, when I view the footer, then it contains book copyright only and no other Docusaurus information

- [X] T031 [US4] Update docusaurus.config.js to use book-specific site title and tagline
- [X] T032 [US4] Update navbar GitHub link to point to textbook repository
- [X] T033 [US4] Update footer to contain only book copyright information
- [X] T034 [US4] Remove all other Docusaurus information from footer
- [X] T035 [US4] Update organizationName and projectName in configuration
- [X] T036 [US4] Replace docusaurus social card with textbook-specific image
- [X] T037 [US4] Update edit URL to point to the textbook repository
- [X] T038 [US4] Verify no "Docusaurus" text appears anywhere on the site

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [X] T039 Update favicons to use book-themed icons if available
- [X] T040 Ensure all frontmatter uses ASCII-safe characters with valid YAML
- [X] T041 Verify all text and navigation elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [X] T042 Test all GitHub links direct to textbook repository (not Docusaurus)
- [X] T043 Validate that all images load within 3 seconds on standard broadband
- [X] T044 Run final site build and verify no errors
- [X] T045 Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- [X] T046 Verify accessibility features work properly (screen readers, etc.)
- [X] T047 Clean up any temporary files or debug information
- [X] T048 Run final validation that site contains 0 visible Docusaurus naming
