**Feature Branch**: `001-branding-fix`
**Created**: Monday, December 22, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Project: A professional technical textbook built with Docusaurus. Current Issues: - Logo image does not render; alt text is shown instead - Images across docs render alt text instead of images - Sidebar order is incorrect and includes unwanted items - Intro page contains Docusaurus-related content - Hero section is Docusaurus-oriented - Footer, navbar, and metadata include Docusaurus branding - GitHub link is not the book repository"

- Q: What are the performance requirements for image rendering? → A: Images must load within 3 seconds on standard broadband
- Q: What happens when image files are temporarily unavailable? → A: Display a fallback image with appropriate alt text
- Q: What should happen when the GitHub link is unavailable? → A: Show a user-friendly error message with alternative contact method

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Correctly Rendered Logo and Images (Priority: P1)

As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see the properly rendered logo and images instead of alt text, so that I can have a better learning experience with visual content that enhances my understanding.

**Why this priority**: Visual content is crucial for a technical textbook, and broken images severely impact user experience and comprehension of the material.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the site and confirming that the logo appears correctly in the header and that all images in the documentation pages render properly rather than showing alt text.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I load the page, **Then** I see the correctly rendered logo in the header instead of alt text
2. **Given** I am browsing any documentation page, **When** I load the page, **Then** all images display properly instead of alt text descriptions

### User Story 2 - Access Correctly Ordered and Relevant Content (Priority: P1)

As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see a properly ordered sidebar with only the required modules, so that I can easily navigate the content in the intended learning sequence.

**Why this priority**: Proper navigation is critical for a textbook's learning flow, and incorrect ordering or unwanted items creates confusion and hinders the learning experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing the sidebar and verifying it contains only the four required modules in the specified order without any extra pages, categories, or autogenerated items.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing any page on the site, **When** I look at the sidebar, **Then** I see exactly: Module 1, Module 2, Module 3, Module 4 in this order
2. **Given** I am viewing any page on the site, **When** I look at the sidebar, **Then** I don't see any extra pages, categories, or autogenerated items

---

### User Story 3 - Experience Book-Focused Content (Priority: P1)

As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see content that introduces the book's topic, scope, and audience instead of Docusaurus-related content, so that I can understand what the book is about and how to use it.

**Why this priority**: Replacing Docusaurus-related content with book-specific information is essential for providing the correct context to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by examining the introductory page and hero section to confirm they contain book-specific information about topic, scope, and audience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I read the intro page, **Then** it introduces the book (topic, scope, audience) instead of Docusaurus
2. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I read the hero section, **Then** it is book-focused (title, subtitle, purpose) instead of Docusaurus-oriented

---

### User Story 4 - Experience Proper Book Branding (Priority: P2)

As a reader of the technical textbook, I want to see content, footer, and metadata that align with the textbook's branding rather than Docusaurus, so that I have a cohesive and professional learning experience.

**Why this priority**: Brand consistency builds credibility and provides a professional experience that matches the textbook's academic nature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by examining the header, footer, and metadata to confirm they reflect the textbook's branding rather than default Docusaurus elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page of the textbook, **When** I view the navbar, **Then** it displays book-specific branding with GitHub link pointing to the user-provided book repository
2. **Given** I am on any page of the textbook, **When** I view the footer, **Then** it contains book copyright only and no other Docusaurus information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a logo image file is temporarily unavailable? → Display a fallback image with appropriate alt text
- How does the system handle different image formats that might not render properly?
- What if a user has images disabled in their browser?
- What if the book repository link is temporarily unavailable? → Show a user-friendly error message with alternative contact method

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST fix all image and logo rendering issues so that logo and all images render correctly (no alt fallback)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate image paths and static asset configuration to ensure proper rendering
- **FR-003**: System MUST replace ALL Docusaurus-related text with book-related content
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure the intro page introduces the book's (topic, scope, audience) and not Docusaurus content
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure the hero section is book-focused (title, subtitle, purpose) and not Docusaurus-oriented
- **FR-006**: System MUST configure the sidebar to contain ONLY: Module 1, Module 2, Module 3, Module 4 in this exact order
- **FR-007**: System MUST exclude any extra pages, categories, or autogenerated items from the sidebar
- **FR-008**: System MUST configure the navbar GitHub link to point to the user-provided book repository (not Docusaurus)
- **FR-009**: System MUST configure the footer to contain book copyright only (no other content)
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all front matter is ASCII-safe with valid YAML only (no special characters in metadata)
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure deterministic outputs and no Docusaurus naming visible anywhere
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide all changes as deliverables: image rendering fix, sidebar structure, intro and hero replacement, branding replacement, and GitHub link configuration
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT modify functionality unrelated to branding fixes (e.g., search functionality, comment systems, user accounts if present)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Brand Elements**: Visual, textual, and metadata components that represent the textbook's identity, including logos, color schemes, introductory content, and copyright information
- **Navigation Structure**: Organized hierarchy of content that enables users to navigate exactly: Module 1, Module 2, Module 3, Module 4 in the specified sequence
- **Static Assets**: All images, logo, and other files that need to be properly referenced and rendered without fallback to alt text
