# Tasks: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Module for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Feature**: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Module Content Creation  
**Branch**: `001-docusaurus-textbook`  
**Generated**: 2025-12-16  
**Context**: Docusaurus documentation at https://docusaurus.io/docs/3.9.2/

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will focus on creating a complete Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) module with 4 chapters as specified. Each chapter will follow Docusaurus best practices for educational content, including proper navigation, rich media support, and accessibility, with a focus on digital twin concepts, Gazebo simulation, Unity integration, and practical applications.

## Dependencies

This module is part of the larger textbook but can be developed independently with the core Docusaurus structure in place.

## Parallel Execution Examples

Content creation for the 4 chapters can proceed in parallel once the basic module structure is established.

---

## Phase 1: Module Setup

- [X] T001 Create module directory structure: my-book/docs/module-2-digital-twin/
- [X] T002 Update sidebar configuration in sidebars.js to include digital twin module

- [X] T004 Configure Docusaurus for digital twin-specific documentation features
- [X] T005 Research digital twin, Gazebo, and Unity fundamentals from official documentation and context7

## Phase 2: Chapter Content Creation

- [X] T006 [P] Create Chapter 1: Digital Twin Concepts and Architecture in my-book/docs/module-2-digital-twin/chapter-1.md
- [X] T007 [P] Create Chapter 2: Gazebo Simulation Fundamentals in my-book/docs/module-2-digital-twin/chapter-2.md
- [X] T008 [P] Create Chapter 3: Unity Integration for Digital Twins in my-book/docs/module-2-digital-twin/chapter-3.md
- [X] T009 [P] Create Chapter 4: Digital Twin Applications and Deployment in my-book/docs/module-2-digital-twin/chapter-4.md

## Phase 3: [US1] Content Formatting and Navigation

2. Each chapter has proper heading structure and accessibility features
3. Content renders correctly with code examples and diagrams

### Implementation Tasks:

- [X] T010 [US1] Format each chapter with proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2-H4 for sections)
- [X] T011 [US1] Add code blocks with proper syntax highlighting for simulation examples
- [X] T012 [US1] Add navigation links between chapters (previous/next)
- [X] T013 [US1] Implement breadcrumbs for the module
- [X] T014 [US1] Ensure content meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- [X] T015 [US1] Add appropriate frontmatter metadata to each chapter file
- [X] T016 [US1] Create table of contents for the module

## Phase 4: [US2] Rich Media and Examples

**Goal**: Enhance the digital twin module with helpful diagrams, code examples, and multimedia content.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
1. All diagrams and images render correctly in chapters
2. Code examples are properly formatted and executable
3. Mathematical formulas render correctly

### Implementation Tasks:

- [X] T017 [US2] Add digital twin architecture diagrams to Chapter 1
- [X] T018 [US2] Create Gazebo simulation workflow diagrams for Chapter 2
- [X] T019 [US2] Add Unity integration architecture diagrams for Chapter 3
- [X] T020 [US2] Create digital twin deployment architecture diagrams for Chapter 4
- [X] T021 [US2] Add executable code examples for each concept
- [X] T022 [US2] Ensure all images have appropriate alt text
- [X] T023 [US2] Format all mathematical formulas using appropriate markup
- [X] T024 [US2] Add video embeds for complex procedures (if available)

## Phase 5: [US3] Integration and Testing

**Goal**: Test the digital twin module as part of the complete textbook experience.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
1. Module integrates properly with the textbook navigation
2. Search functionality works across the digital twin module content
3. Export functionality works for individual chapters

### Implementation Tasks:

- [X] T025 [US3] Test module navigation within the full textbook structure
- [X] T026 [US3] Ensure search indexes digital twin module content properly
- [X] T027 [US3] Test PDF export functionality for each digital twin chapter
- [X] T028 [US3] Verify all links and cross-references work correctly
- [X] T029 [US3] Validate content meets academic standards (3000-5000 words requirement)
- [X] T030 [US3] Add cross-references between related digital twin concepts across chapters

## Phase 6: Polish & Finalization

- [X] T031 Review and refine all content for technical accuracy
- [X] T032 Conduct peer review of digital twin content
