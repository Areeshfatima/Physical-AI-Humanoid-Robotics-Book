# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This educational resource provides in-depth coverage of the fundamental concepts, technologies, and methodologies essential for understanding and developing humanoid robotic systems.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is organized into four modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics:

1. **ROS2 Fundamentals** - Core concepts of Robot Operating System 2
2. **Module 2** - [To be developed]
3. **Module 3** - [To be developed]
4. **Module 4** - [To be developed]

Each module contains four chapters designed to provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementation knowledge.

## Learning Approach

This textbook combines theoretical foundations with practical examples, encouraging hands-on learning through implementation exercises and project-based learning. The content is designed to build upon previous knowledge, creating a comprehensive learning path from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

## Target Audience
