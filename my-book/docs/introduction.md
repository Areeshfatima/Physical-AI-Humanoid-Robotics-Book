# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Textbook

Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines artificial intelligence, robotics, control systems, and physics to create embodied agents that can interact with the physical world.

## Overview

This textbook covers the fundamental concepts, technologies, and applications of humanoid robotics, with a focus on:
- The integration of AI with physical systems
- Simulation environments for robot development
- Vision-Language-Action systems
- Real-world robotics applications

## Prerequisites

This textbook assumes a basic understanding of:
- Programming (Python preferred)
- Linear algebra
- Physics fundamentals
- Machine learning concepts

## Structure

The textbook is organized into four main modules:
1. ROS2 Fundamentals and Architecture
2. Digital Twins and Simulation
3. Isaac Sim and Navigation Systems
4. Vision-Language-Action Systems
