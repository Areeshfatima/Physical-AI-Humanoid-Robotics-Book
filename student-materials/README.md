# Student Materials: Digital Twin with Gazebo & Unity

This directory contains educational materials for students learning about digital twins with physics-accurate Gazebo simulation and Unity visualization.

## Structure

- `getting-started/` - Basics of ROS 2 and simulation
- `gazebo-physics/` - Physics simulation concepts and setup
- `sensors/` - Sensor simulation and configuration
- `unity-visualization/` - Unity integration and visualization
- `examples/` - Complete examples combining all concepts

## Getting Started

1. Start with the `getting-started` section to familiarize yourself with the basics
2. Proceed through each section in order to build your understanding gradually
3. Work through the complete examples to see everything working together

## Technical Requirements

- Computer with Linux Ubuntu 22.04
- Sufficient RAM and a dedicated GPU for simulation and visualization
- All software dependencies as described in the quickstart guide

## Learning Objectives

After completing these materials, you should be able to:
- Create physics-accurate robot simulations in Gazebo
- Configure and simulate robot sensors
- Integrate with Unity for high-fidelity visualization
- Build custom simulation environments
- Understand the complete digital twin workflow

## Support
