## Prompt

Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for the feature based on available design artifacts. Context for task generation: - Audit and fix static asset paths for logo and images - Enforce correct image rendering (disable alt fallback) - Replace intro.md with book-specific introduction - Replace hero section with book-focused content - Remove all Docusaurus branding from UI - Generate sidebar with only Module 1–4 in correct order - Remove all extra sidebar items and autogenerated content - Update navbar GitHub link to book repository - Validate YAML front matter across all docs.

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Response snapshot

Generated an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md file for the Docusaurus branding fix feature with 47 specific tasks organized across 7 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup - 4 tasks for project initialization
2. Phase 2: Foundational - 5 tasks for blocking prerequisites
3. Phase 3: [US1] View Correctly Rendered Logo and Images - 8 tasks for image rendering
4. Phase 4: [US2] Access Correctly Ordered and Relevant Content - 7 tasks for sidebar structure
5. Phase 5: [US3] Experience Book-Focused Content - 6 tasks for content updates
6. Phase 6: [US4] Experience Proper Book Branding - 8 tasks for branding updates
7. Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns - 9 tasks for final validation

Each task follows the required checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. Identified 5 parallel execution opportunities and mapped dependencies between user stories.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown with 47 actionable items for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Planning phase - no tests required at this stage
- 📁 Files: tasks.md with structured, actionable tasks organized by user story
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation of tasks or review tasks.md before execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-structured and follow the dependency-ordered approach, enabling systematic implementation of the branding fix

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all planning steps completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A for planning phase
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard tasks generation prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin execution of tasks in tasks.md
