# Module 2 - Digital Twins (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

This module covers the creation and utilization of digital twins in robotics using Gazebo and Unity simulation environments. You'll learn how to build accurate virtual representations of physical robots and environments for testing and development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create realistic robot models for simulation
- Implement physics-based environments in Gazebo
- Develop immersive robot simulations in Unity
- Integrate simulation with ROS2 control
- Validate robot behavior in virtual environments

## Module Structure

2. [Gazebo Simulation Environment](./chapter-2)
3. [Unity Robotics Simulation](./chapter-3)
4. [Simulation to Real-World Transfer](./chapter-4)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 on ROS2 Foundations
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Familiarity with physics simulation concepts

## Getting Started

Digital twins are virtual representations of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, analysis, and optimization. In robotics, digital twins play a crucial role in:

- Testing robot behaviors in safe virtual environments
- Validating control algorithms before deployment
- Training machine learning models
- Prototyping robot designs
- Conducting experiments that would be infeasible with physical robots

This module will explore two leading simulation platforms: Gazebo, widely adopted in the ROS community, and Unity, popular for its graphics capabilities and real-time performance.
