# ROS2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the ROS2 Fundamentals module, where you'll learn the core concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). This module is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in ROS2 architecture, communication patterns, and development practices essential for physical AI and humanoid robotics applications.

## Overview

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms and applications.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will explore:

1. **ROS2 Overview and Architecture** - Understanding the core concepts and design principles behind ROS2
2. **ROS2 Nodes and Topics** - Learning about the fundamental communication patterns in ROS2
3. **ROS2 Services and Actions** - Exploring advanced communication patterns for request-response and goal-oriented interactions
4. **ROS2 Launch Systems and Package Management** - Managing complex systems and organizing your ROS2 projects

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- Familiarity with Python or C++ programming
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the key differences between ROS and ROS2
- Design and implement basic ROS2 nodes
- Create publishers and subscribers for topic-based communication
- Implement services and actions for more complex interactions
- Organize and launch complex ROS2 systems
