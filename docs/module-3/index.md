2. [Perception Systems for Navigation](./chapter-2)
3. [Mapping and Localization](./chapter-3)
4. [Navigation Algorithms and Path Planning](./chapter-4)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Understanding of sensor systems (LiDAR, cameras, IMU)
- Knowledge of basic control systems

## Getting Started

Navigation is a fundamental capability for mobile robots, enabling them to move autonomously in known or unknown environments. This module will focus on leveraging NVIDIA Isaac Sim to develop and test navigation systems in realistic environments.

Isaac Sim provides:
- Photorealistic rendering for computer vision applications
- Accurate physics simulation
- Support for complex sensor models
- Integration with AI training workflows
- Scalable simulation environments

The combination of realistic simulation and powerful AI capabilities makes Isaac Sim an ideal platform for developing navigation systems that can be successfully transferred to real robots.
