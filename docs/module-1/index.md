# Module 1 - ROS 2 Foundations

## Overview

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), the middleware framework that powers modern robotics applications. You'll learn about the core components that make up ROS2 and how they interact to create complex robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and components of ROS2
- Create and manage ROS2 packages
- Implement nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Design and implement launch files
- Debug and profile ROS2 applications

## Module Structure

1. [Introduction to ROS2 Architecture](./chapter-1)
2. [ROS2 Packages and Workspaces](./chapter-2)
3. [Nodes, Topics, Services and Actions](./chapter-3)
4. [Launch Files and Parameters](./chapter-4)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic programming knowledge in C++ or Python
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with version control systems like Git

## Getting Started

ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an operating system, but rather a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions designed to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms and applications.

Unlike its predecessor ROS1, ROS2 is built on DDS (Data Distribution Service) and addresses many of the limitations of ROS1, including real-time support, security, and multi-robot systems.
